# ALU

The **ALU** (Arithmetic Logic Unit) in Ben Eater's 8-bit computer is a crucial component responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. It is designed to operate on **8-bit** binary data.

The ALU consists of various logic gates and circuits that enable it to execute different operations, including:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Logical AND
- Logical OR
- Bitwise operations like shifting.

The ALU receives inputs from the computer's registers and carries out the specified operation based on control signals. It performs calculations and produces outputs that can be stored back in the registers or used for further processing.

By carefully configuring the control signals, the ALU can perform a wide range of operations, making it a versatile component of the computer system. Ben Eater's ALU design is based on a combination of combinatorial logic and sequential logic, ensuring accurate and efficient computation.

The ALU plays a vital role in enabling the computer to perform arithmetic calculations, logical comparisons, and data manipulation, contributing to the overall functionality of the 8-bit computer.
