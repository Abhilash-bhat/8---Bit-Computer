## Module Overview

MAR is a simple 4-bit register, that holds/points to a RAM[^1] location. 
It is the basic block, through which data can be given to the computer for computations. It guides through the complete sequence of operations, without which the computer cannot compute at all.
 
## Components

- **IC 74LS173** : 4-Bit D-type registers with 3-state Outputs.
- **IC 74LS157** : Quad 2-line to 1-line data multiplexers/selectors.
