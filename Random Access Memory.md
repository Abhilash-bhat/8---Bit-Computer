## Overview

The RAM module is a fundamental component of our 8-bit computer project, serving as a crucial part of the computer's memory architecture. RAM, short for Random Access Memory, functions as a temporary data storage medium that allows fast access to information needed by the Central Processing Unit (CPU) during program execution.

The main purpose of the RAM module is to efficiently handle data and instructions while running programs. It provides rapid read and write access, making it an essential element of the memory hierarchy in modern computing systems.
